Description: git-svn extension for magit
 This package provides basic support for Git-Svn.
 .
 Git-Svn is a Git command that aims to provide bidirectional
 operation between a Subversion repository and Git.
 .
 When `magit-svn-mode' is turned on then the unpushed and unpulled
 commit relative to the Subversion repository are displayed in the
 status buffer, and `N' is bound to a popup with commands that wrap
 the `git svn' subcommands fetch, rebase, dcommit, branch and tag,
 as well as a few extras.
